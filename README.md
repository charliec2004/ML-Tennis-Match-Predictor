A machine learning system for predicting professional tennis match outcomes using advanced ELO ratings, match history analysis, and gradient boosting algorithms.

## Project Overview

### What This Project Does

This system predicts the outcome of professional tennis matches by analyzing historical match data and player performance patterns. Given two players and match conditions (surface, tournament type, etc.), it calculates the probability of each player winning. For a more formal high-level overview of this project refer to notebooks/tennis_match_predictor.md.

### How It Works

The prediction pipeline consists of four main components:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Transforms raw match data into 38 meaningful features
2. **ELO Rating System**: Calculates dynamic player strength ratings that evolve over time
3. **XGBoost Model**: Uses gradient boosting to learn complex patterns from historical data
4. **Prediction Pipeline**: Applies the trained model to future matches

### Why This Approach

Tennis match prediction is inherently challenging due to:

- **Player form fluctuations** over time and surfaces
- **Head-to-head dynamics** between specific players
- **Surface specialization** (some players excel on clay, others on hard courts)
- **Tournament pressure** varying by event importance

This system addresses these challenges through:

- **Surface-specific ELO ratings** that track performance on different court types
- **Time-based training splits** that prevent data leakage and simulate real-world prediction scenarios
- **Historical match patterns** including win rates and recent form
- **Head-to-head statistics** for player matchup analysis

### Performance Context

**Industry Standard**: Professional tennis prediction platforms (with access to betting odds, injury reports, and real-time data) typically achieve **70-75% accuracy**.

**This Model's Performance**:

- **Training Data Accuracy**: 69.96% (on historical matches 2000-2018)
- **Future Prediction Accuracy**: 65.45% (on unseen matches 2023+)
- **Test AUC**: 0.7192 (good discrimination ability)

The 4.5% accuracy drop from training to future predictions is expected and healthy - it indicates the model generalizes well without overfitting to historical patterns.

### Model Validation & Testing

The system was rigorously tested using multiple approaches:

1. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - **ELO-only predictions**: Used surface-specific ELO ratings alone
   - **Logistic Regression**: Traditional linear model with the same features
   - **XGBoost**: Final gradient boosting model (best performance)

2. **Time-Based Validation**:
   - **Training**: 2000-2018 (50,280 matches)
   - **Validation**: 2019-2022 (8,675 matches)
   - **Test**: 2023+ (7,019 matches) - completely unseen data

3. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - ELO difference is the strongest predictor (132.6 importance)
   - Ranking ratios and surface factors follow
   - 38 features selected from 49 generated features

The model's **65.45% accuracy on future matches** is competitive considering:

- Limited to publicly available historical data (65,974 matches)
- No access to real-time factors (injuries, recent form, weather)
- No betting market information or expert insights
- Purely algorithmic approach without human expertise

## Features

- **Advanced ELO Rating System**: Surface-specific ELO ratings (Hard, Clay, Grass, Carpet)
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: 38 features including rankings, match statistics, and historical performance
- **Time-Based Training**: Chronological data splits to prevent data leakage
- **XGBoost Model**: Optimized gradient boosting with early stopping and regularization
- **Match Prediction Pipeline**: End-to-end system from raw data to predictions
- **Professional Tournament Support**: ATP, Grand Slam, and other professional tournaments

## Model Performance

### Training vs. Future Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: 69.96% (historical matches 2000-2018)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 64.77% (validation set 2019-2022)
- **Test Accuracy**: 65.45% (future matches 2023+)
- **Test AUC**: 0.7192 (strong discrimination ability)

### Model Comparison Results

- **XGBoost**: 65.45% accuracy (final model)
- **Logistic Regression**: ~62% accuracy (baseline)
- **ELO-only**: ~58% accuracy (simple baseline)

### Industry Context

- **Professional Platforms**: 70-75% accuracy (with extensive data access)
- **This Model**: 65.45% accuracy (publicly available data only)
- **Random Baseline**: 50% accuracy

**Training Data**: 65,974 professional matches (2000-2025)  
**Best Trees Used**: 332 (with early stopping)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd US-OPEN-PREDICTOR

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
